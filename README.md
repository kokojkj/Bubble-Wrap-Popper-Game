# This is my Bubble Wrap Popper Game  
**A good and simple game with some cool things!**  

## Highlights:  
- first there is a small challange if you want to pop all bubbles in 30 seconds (try to finish in 10 seconds and see what will happen)
- second the pop sound made entirly with js ! (very cool right but very hard)
